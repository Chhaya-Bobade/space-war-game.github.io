 I developed the SpaceWarGame-2D using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 I am using various images in png formats such as alien, plane, space and fire. 
 For the Sounds effects, used audio files such as fireex.wav, collion.wav and gameover.wav.

There are few points about game.

1. Disappear, aliens, when players shoot them.
2. Ensure that only bottom aliens get to disappear.
3. Speed becomes faster with time
4. Aliens also can attack
5. Score and Lives of the player
